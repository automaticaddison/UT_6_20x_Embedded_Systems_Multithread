# UT_6_20x_Embedded_Systems_Multithread
This is a repository for all the lab assignments I've completed during UT.6.20x Embedded Systems - Shape The World: Multi-Threaded Interfacing

## MOOC Details
__Site:__ [edX](https://www.edx.org/course/embedded-systems-shape-the-world-multi-threaded-interfacing)  
__Date:__ August - September 2018<br />
__School:__ University of Texas at Austin  

## Description
Each folder will contain all the necessary files for the specified lab.  
Some labs required constructing a physical electrical circuit.

## Common Files
There are some file types that appear in every lab asssignment.  
`***.uvproj` `***.uvgui` `***.uvopt` - uVision files (open `***.uvproj` to get everthing)  
`***.axf` `TExaS.h` `texas.o` - autograder files   
`tm4c123gh6pm.h` - useful address definitions for launchpad  
`startup.s` - startup file  

## Requirements
[__Kiel uVsion 4__](https://www.keil.com/demo/eval/armv4.htm) - Coding exercises were completed using this IDE<br />
[__Tiva LaunchPad__](http://www.ti.com/tool/EK-TM4C123GXL) - Texas Instruments TM4C123 microcontroller kit that has an ARM Cortex-M4 processor.<br /> 
[__Electronic Components__](http://edx-org-utaustinx.s3.amazonaws.com/UT601x/worldwide.html) - The physical circuit requires a few miscellaneous electrical components.  

## Other Resources
[__e-Book__](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~valvano/Volume1/E-Book/) - e-Book is basically a transcript of the entire course
